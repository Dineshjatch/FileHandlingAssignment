        "Que 1.  What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "-  Compiled Languages:\n",
        " - Translation: Code is translated all at once into machine code by a compiler before it runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Execution: After compiling, the program runs directly from the compiled machine code.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Speed: Generally faster because the translation happens before execution.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Interpreted Languages:\n",
        " - Translation: Code is translated line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Execution: The program runs while being interpreted, without a separate compilation step.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Speed: Usually slower than compiled languages due to on-the-fly translation.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que 2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Exception handling in Python is the process of responding to exceptions (errors) that occur during program execution using try, except, else, and finally blocks to prevent the program from crashing and to handle errors gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "Que 3. What is the purpose of the finally block in Python's exception handling?\n",
        " - The finally block is used to execute a section of code regardless of whether an exception is raised or not. It’s typically used for clean-up operations like closing files, releasing system resources, or resetting variables—tasks that must be performed no matter what happens in the try/except blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "- Logging in Python is a built-in way to keep track of events that occur during the execution of a program. It records information such as errors, warnings, and operational details, helping developers debug issues and monitor how a program is functioning in production environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The __del__ method is known as a destructor in Python and is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It’s generally used to clean up external resources like open files or database connections, although its use is discouraged in many cases because the exact time of object destruction isn't guaranteed due to garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "- The import statement loads an entire module, requiring you to use the module name to access functions or classes (e.g., math.sqrt). In contrast, from ... import allows you to import specific functions or classes directly into your code, eliminating the need to use the module prefix (e.g., from math import sqrt).\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        "- You can handle multiple exceptions by using multiple except blocks for different error types or by grouping exceptions in a single except block using a tuple. This approach allows your program to respond specifically and appropriately to different types of errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "- The with statement ensures that resources such as file handles are properly managed. It automatically opens and closes a file, even if an error occurs during file operations, which helps prevent resource leaks and ensures consistent behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "- Multithreading runs multiple threads within a single process and shares the same memory space, making it suitable for I/O-bound tasks. Multiprocessing, on the other hand, runs separate processes with isolated memory spaces, making it more effective for CPU-bound tasks and avoiding issues like thread safety.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "- Logging provides valuable insights into the internal workings of an application. It helps track program flow, diagnose issues, monitor performance, and store execution history, all of which are essential for maintaining and debugging software, especially in production environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Memory management in Python involves the allocation, use, and deallocation of memory during a program’s execution. Python handles this automatically through mechanisms like reference counting and garbage collection, helping developers avoid manual memory management.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "- Exception handling involves writing risky code inside a try block, catching specific exceptions using except, optionally executing code with else if no errors occur, and always running clean-up code with finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "- Efficient memory management ensures that a Python program uses only the memory it needs, which prevents memory leaks, improves performance, and helps applications run smoothly—especially important in long-running or resource-intensive applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "- The try block contains code that might raise an exception, while the except block specifies how to respond if an exception occurs. This structure allows programs to handle errors gracefully without crashing.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python’s garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python automatically manages memory using reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector. When an object is no longer referenced, Python reclaims its memory. For objects in reference cycles, the garbage collector can detect and clean them up.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "- The else block runs only if the try block does not raise an exception. It’s useful for placing code that should execute only when no errors occur, helping keep the code organized and easier to understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "- Python has five standard logging levels: DEBUG (detailed information), INFO (general events), WARNING (something unexpected), ERROR (a serious problem), and CRITICAL (a very severe error).\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and the multiprocessing module in Python?\n",
        "- os.fork() is a Unix-only method to create a child process by duplicating the parent. The multiprocessing module is cross-platform and provides a more user-friendly, high-level API for creating processes and managing parallel tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "- Closing a file releases system resources and ensures that any data written to the file is properly saved. Not closing files can lead to data corruption or memory/resource leaks, especially in large applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "- file.read() reads the entire file content at once as a string, while file.readline() reads just a single line at a time. readline() is more memory-efficient for reading large files line-by-line.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "- The logging module is a built-in Python tool used to write log messages to the console or files. It allows developers to monitor applications, record errors, and gain insight into runtime behavior across different environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "- The os module provides functions for interacting with the operating system. It helps with tasks like checking if files or directories exist, creating/removing folders, and navigating the file system.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "- Common challenges include managing reference cycles, avoiding memory leaks from global variables, and ensuring efficient memory use in long-running or high-performance applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "- You can manually raise an exception using the raise statement, followed by the exception type and an optional error message. For example: raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\").\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "- Multithreading is useful in I/O-bound applications like web servers or GUI programs, where tasks can run concurrently without blocking each other. It helps improve responsiveness and performance by handling multiple tasks simultaneously within a single process."
